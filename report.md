# Final Project Report

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a database system for managing information about natural parks and protected areas in Argentina. The system will provide tools for tracking ecological data, visitor statistics, and park management activities.

## Design Approach
1. **Test-Driven Development:** We follow a test-first approach to ensure all requirements are clearly defined and met.
2. **Modular Implementation:** Implement core functionalities first, progressively adding more features while maintaining test coverage.
3. **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of design decisions and trade-offs.

## Current Status
### Implemented Requirements:
- Initial test framework setup

### Next Steps:
1. Complete database schema definition
2. Implement data validation constraints
3. Add query functionality

## Assumptions
1. We are using **MySQL** as the database engine. (Updated from original assumption)
2. All data will be stored in a single database instance (`park_management`) for simplicity.
3. Park codes (`parks.code`) are unique identifiers for parks (e.g., 'A', 'B').
4. Visitors are directly associated with the park they are visiting (`visitors.park_id`), even though they stay in accommodations. This simplifies querying visitor counts per park.

## Design Decisions & Simplifications
- **Surveillance Vehicle:** The `surveillance_personnel` table links a vehicle directly to the personnel member. The requirement nuance "siempre es el mismo en cada Ã¡rea que vigila" (always the same in each area they watch) is simplified; we assume one primary vehicle per surveillance staff member rather than tracking vehicle assignments per area vigilated. This meets the requirement as stated, assuming a single vehicle per staff member across all their assigned areas.
- **Research Element Link:** Implemented via `research_projects.element_id` foreign key, assuming a project focuses on one primary element.
- **Conservation Area Link:** Implemented via `conservation_personnel.park_id` and `conservation_personnel.area_number` composite foreign key, assuming a conservation staff member is assigned to one specific area.
- **Element Food Constraints:** The constraints preventing minerals from being food (`check_mineral_not_food`) and preventing plants from feeding (`check_vegetal_not_feeding`) are implemented using `BEFORE INSERT` and `BEFORE UPDATE` triggers on the `element_food` table. This approach was chosen because MySQL does not support subqueries within `CHECK` constraints.
- **Visitor-Excursion Link:** A many-to-many relationship table `visitor_excursions` was added to link visitors to the excursions they attend, fulfilling requirement 13.c.

## Trade-offs
- **Test Focus vs Implementation Speed:** By focusing on tests first, we ensure quality but may initially be slower than direct implementation.
- **Schema Complexity vs Requirement Fidelity:** Some relationships (mentioned in Simplifications) were omitted or simplified to reduce schema complexity and meet the "minimal effort" guideline. Some constraints (like element food rules) were removed due to database engine limitations, shifting enforcement responsibility.
