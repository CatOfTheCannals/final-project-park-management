# Final Project Report

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a database system for managing information about natural parks and protected areas in Argentina. The system will provide tools for tracking ecological data, visitor statistics, and park management activities.

## Design Approach
1. **Test-Driven Development:** We follow a test-first approach to ensure all requirements are clearly defined and met.
2. **Modular Implementation:** Implement core functionalities first, progressively adding more features while maintaining test coverage.
3. **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of design decisions and trade-offs.

## Current Status
### Implemented Requirements:
- Initial test framework setup

### Next Steps:
1. Complete database schema definition
2. Implement data validation constraints
3. Add query functionality

## Assumptions
1. We are using PostgreSQL as the database engine due to its robust feature set.
2. All data will be stored in a single database instance for simplicity.

## Trade-offs
- **Test Focus vs Implementation Speed:** By focusing on tests first, we ensure quality but may initially slower than direct implementation.
