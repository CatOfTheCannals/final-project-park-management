# General Requirements
1. The project is a database system for managing information about natural parks.
2. The system should store information about provinces, parks, natural elements (vegetal, animal, mineral), park personnel, visitors, and accommodations.
3. The system should use a database engine (MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server).
4. The database should contain test data for demonstration.
5. The project should include documentation (Carátula, Introducción, ER model, Relational model, Assumptions, Physical design, Code, Conclusions).

# Data Requirements
1. Store information about provinces, including the responsible organization for parks.
2. Store information about parks, including name, declaration date, contact email, and area.
3. Store information about park areas, including name and extension.
4. Store information about natural elements (vegetal, animal, mineral) residing in each area, including scientific name, common name, and number of individuals.
5. Store specific information for vegetal elements (flowering period).
6. Store specific information for animal elements (diet, mating season).
7. Store specific information for mineral elements (crystal or rock).
8. Track which elements serve as food for other elements (excluding minerals feeding on anything and vegetal elements feeding on other elements).
9. Store information about park personnel (DNI, CUIL, name, address, phone numbers, salary).
10. Differentiate between different types of personnel: management, surveillance, research, and conservation.
11. Store information about visitors (DNI, name, address, profession).
12. Store information about accommodations (capacity, category).
13. Store information about excursions (days of the week, time), and which accommodations organize them.

# Functional Requirements
1. Determine the province with the most natural parks.
2. Identify vegetal species found in at least half of the parks.
3. Count the number of visitors in parks with specific codes (A and B).
4. Implement a trigger that sends an email to the park's contact email when the quantity of a species decreases.
5. Implement database constraints based on the problem domain.

# Additional Requirements from 2019 TP
1. Verify if public information can be used in the model (e.g., a list of national parks).
2. Estimate the size of the tables.
3. Identify species found in all parks.
4. Identify species found in only one park.
5. Propose suitable indexes for the queries and analyze the execution plan.
6. Create a procedure that compares tables, indexes, and constraints of two databases.
7. Investigate concurrency control and recovery mechanisms in two commercial database engines.
